- v1 - Very buggy, has log spam which can rapidly decrease FPS and can cause disk usage to rise drastically, has a bug at 2^35 which causes stripes of chunks to not load
every power of 2, Chunk overwrite limit causes chunk and entity relocation spam, highly unstable. Player will be affected.
- v2 - Most issues are fixed, log spam is fixed
- v3 - Fixes 2^35 bug, Slowfalling still exists (due to server thread becoming overloaded)
