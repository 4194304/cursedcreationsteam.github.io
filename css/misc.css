/* This stylesheet is for miscellaneous things that I couldn't find a place for.
Items may have inaccurate names that don't reflect what they do. 
For everything except for centeredtext and justifytext, they didn't make any visible changes, so I made up a few names.
Hopefully this clears things up! */
